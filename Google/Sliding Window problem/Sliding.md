## Sliding Window

Yes, the sliding window approach is a technique commonly used in `array` and `string` problems, where you want to iterate through a sequence of elements while keeping track of a `window` of a fixed size, and perform some operations on the elements within that window.

The key idea is that instead of iterating through all possible subarrays of size k, `you can keep track of a single window of size k` as you iterate through the array, and update the window by moving one element at a time. `This allows you to achieve a linear time complexity, O(n)`, because you are processing each element of the array exactly once.

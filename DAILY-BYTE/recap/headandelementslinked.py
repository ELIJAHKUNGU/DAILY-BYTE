# Given a reference to the head of a linked list and two values, m, and n, traverse the entire list 
# keeping the first m elements followed by removing the next n elements. Return the resulting list.

# Ex: Given the following head, m, and n…

# 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null, m = 1, n = 1, return 1 -> 3 -> null.
# Ex: Given the following head, m, and n…

# 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> null, m = 2, n = 2, return 1 -> 3 -> null.

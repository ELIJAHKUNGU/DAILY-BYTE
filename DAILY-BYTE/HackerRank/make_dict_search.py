# # The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of entries in the phone book.
# # Each of the n subsequent lines describes an entry in the form of 2 space-separated values on a single line. The first value is a friendâ€™s name, and the second value is an 8-digit phone number.

# # After the n lines of phone book entries, there are an unknown number of lines of queries. Each line (query) contains a name to look up, and you must continue reading lines until there is no more input.

# # Note: Names consist of lowercase English alphabetic letters and are first names only.

# Query 0: sam
# Sam is one of the keys in our dictionary, so we print sam=99912222.

# Query 1: edward
# Edward is not one of the keys in our dictionary, so we print Not found.

# Query 2: harry
# Harry is one of the keys in our dictionary, so we print harry=12299933.

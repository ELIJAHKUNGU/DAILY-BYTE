## LET 

 The `let` statement declares a block scope local variable.
 Hence the variables defined with let keyword are limited
 in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which
 it is used.
 
 ## VAR
  Whereas variables declared with the `var` 
 keyword used to define a variable globally, or locally
  to an entire function  regardless of block scope.

  ## CONST
